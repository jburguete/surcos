We present SURCOS, a new software to solve fertigation in furrow networks

The model solves surface flow, solute dispersion, infiltration and junctions

The hydrodynamic model is solved with an explicit Eulerian high-order method

The model is very fast in isolated furrows and reasonably fast in big furrow networks
