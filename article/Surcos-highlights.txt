We present SURCOS, a software tool to simulate fertigation in furrow networks

It solves both unsteady surface flows with solute dispersion and infiltration

The conservation error in water and solute mass is reduced to machine accuracy

The model relies on a fully tested, robust, and accurate numerical method

The program is easy to use, runs fast and can be freely downloaded
