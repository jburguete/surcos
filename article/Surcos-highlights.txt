We present SURCOS, a software tool to simulate fertigation in furrow networks and isolated furrows

It solves both unsteady surface flows with solute dispersion and infiltration

The numerical error in water and solute mass is ensured to be below the machine accuracy

The model relies on a previously verified and validated, robust and accurate numerical method

The program is fast, easy and free
