\chapter*{Warning!}

To execute the program \emph{surcos} on operative system Windows init the
application on the subdirectory \emph{win32/bin/winsurcos.exe}, with 32 bits
versions, or \emph{win64/bin/winsurcos.exe} with 64 bits versions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Real numbers are represented according to the international standard,
separating the integer and decimal parts by ``.''.
\item All units are in the International System.
\end{itemize}

The program has been tested in the following operative systems of Microsoft:
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows XP 32 bits.
\item Windows XP 64 bits.
\item Windows 7 32 bits.
\item Windows 7 64 bits.
\end{itemize}

The language activation is perfomed through the regional configuration in the 
operative system. Version 5.2 is offered in English, Spanish, French and Italian. 

Some problems with graphic representation have been reported due to OpenGL 
configuration failure in the graphical card driver. In that case, the latest driver
should be installed.

Other failures have been reported when saving the graphical file if Windows is
executed in a VirtualBox. In that case, the graphical acceleration should be desactivated
in the VirtualBox configuration.

\item[zlib] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng)
\item[libxml] (http://xmlsoft.org)
\item[libffi] (ftp://sourceware.org/pub/libffi)
\item[glib] (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib)
\item[gettext] (http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext)
\item[libpng] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng)
\item[freetype] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype)
\item[fontconfig] (http://fontconfig.freedesktop.org)
\item[pixman] (http://www.cairographics.org)
\item[cairo] (http://www.cairographics.org)
\item[atk] (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/atk)
\item[pango] (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/pango)
\item[gdk-pixbuf] (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gdk-pixbuf)
\item[gtk+] (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+)
\item[freeglut] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeglut)
\end{description}

Once installed and configurated all the tools and libraries, the sequence to compile is made of four steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item aclocal
\item autoconf
\item ./configure
\item make
\end{enumerate}
Some systems require corrections. Look at the beginning of the file configure.ac
where more detailed instructions are provided.
